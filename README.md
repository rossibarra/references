references
==========

Put all your bibtex refs here.  For a given paper, in the \bibliography{} command put the full path to the repo on your computer.  Make sure to include a url to the repo somewhere in the paper (comments, readme) so others can grab the references too.

All entries *should* have keys that are ABC where A is the last name of the first author, B is the full year, and C is the first word of the title.  All words (including author last name) should be lowercase.

Initial commit will not follow the above rules; it is hoped we will fix as this becomes used.
